# Basic Sample Hardhat Project - with Starknet Plugin
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat project, but with [Starknet plugin](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-hardhat-plugin).

## Synchronization with the plugin
Sometimes, the examples in this project will not be in sync with the latest plugin version.

Your can either wait until a new version is published (which is soon - typically within a day), or checkout a previous commit, e.g. `git checkout @~1`.
